   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\assets\img\2019-05-May\2019-05-16-Zion-National-Park-Should-be-a-UNESCO-World-Heritage-Site\montage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Montage&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zion National Park is a large and beautiful park in Utah. Millions of visitors visit annually to hike its scenic terrain. Why is Zion not on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-unesco&quot;&gt;What is UNESCO?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNESCO is an agency of the United Nations that promotes science, education, and culture. One of the ways they do this is with a list of World Heritage Sites. To make it on the list, a site must be judged of significance to the collective interests of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built a model using machine learning to classify whether a site would make it on the UNESCO list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach&quot;&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNESCO sites are divided into two types, one is cultural. These are man-made sites such as The Statue of Liberty or The Great Wall of China. The other type is natural. Natural sites are parks, marine areas, and landforms that exhibit outstanding examples plant and animal life. I focused on the natural sites, specifically the parks. The parks have more consistent features that can be used to build a model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-data&quot;&gt;Getting the Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gathered data from UNESCO, the US National Park Service, the Canadian National Park Service, and TripAdvisor for reviews about each park. The US and Canadian Park Service gave me observations of parks not on the UNESCO list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The features that I looked at were size of the park, age of the park, TripAdvisor review score and Number of TripAdvisor reviews. The number of reviews was important because some sites had a very high rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019-05-May/2019-05-16-Zion-National-Park-Should-be-a-UNESCO-World-Heritage-Site/torngat_trip_advisor.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;High Rating&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only one review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019-05-May/2019-05-16-Zion-National-Park-Should-be-a-UNESCO-World-Heritage-Site/torngat_trip_advisor1.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;One Review&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I combined review score and number of reviews into a single metric “weighted reviews” that accounts for the number of reviews. This also serves as proxy as number of visitors to a park that is important in the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-out-machine-learning-algorithms&quot;&gt;Testing out Machine Learning Algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used F1 score as my scoring metric. A baseline model that always predicts a park is a UNESCO site had an F1 score of 49%. I trained six different machine learning models with my data and here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019-05-May/2019-05-16-Zion-National-Park-Should-be-a-UNESCO-World-Heritage-Site/f1_score_by_model.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;F1 Scores by Model&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A support vector machine (SVM) model was the best performer with a F1 score of 62%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-exactly-can-this-model-do&quot;&gt;What Exactly Can This Model Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a set of park features, I can input them into the model will look at the data I used to train it and output a prediction whether a park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019-05-May/2019-05-16-Zion-National-Park-Should-be-a-UNESCO-World-Heritage-Site/prediction.png&quot; alt=&quot;Prediction&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model predicts that Zion National Park should be classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-forward&quot;&gt;Going Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model currently has a F1 score of 62% on 140 parks, 70 that were UNESCO sites and 70 that were non-UNESCO sites. I would like to add more parks from all around the world to see if I can increase the F1 score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a strong enough score, the model would be used to find those parks that are not currently UNESCO sites that should be UNESCO sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\assets\img\2019-05-May\2019-05-19-Classifying-Animals-Using-Machine-Learning\mini_highland_cow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mini Highland Cow&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a mini highland cow. From the image, we see that it has hair, a tail,
and four legs. Some other things that we know about this animal is that it has
teeth and it produces milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mini highland cow’s attributes are what are called the features of the
animal. The class it belongs to is the mammal class. My goal is to develop a
model that maps from the features of an animal to its class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-data&quot;&gt;The Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data
I used a data set from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/zoo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCI Machine Learning repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\assets\img\2019-05-May\2019-05-19-Classifying-Animals-Using-Machine-Learning\animal_classes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Animal Classes&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animals are divided into seven classes. A particularly interesting class is
the non-insect invertebrate class. It includes are a variety of animals from
worms, arachnids, crustaceans, mollusks, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\assets\img\2019-05-May\2019-05-19-Classifying-Animals-Using-Machine-Learning\number_of_animals_by_class.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Number of Animals by Class&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 101 animals in the data set. There were only five reptiles and four
amphibians. This is important to keep in mind during the splitting of the data.
I want at least one example of reptile and amphibian in my testing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-exploration-preprocessing-and-cleaning&quot;&gt;Data exploration, preprocessing, and cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a clean data set with no missing values or outliers. The only non-binary feature was the number of legs of each animal. I scaled the number of legs to values between 0 and 1 using a max-min scaler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modeling&quot;&gt;Modeling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many algorithms to choose for classification. There is a rule of thumb for logistic regression requiring ten training observations per feature to have properly calibrated model probabilities. I decided to not use logistic regression. Naive Bayes has the assumption that the features used are independent. Since I had features such as “Does this animal have fins” and “Does this animal live in the water”, my features were not independent. I decided not to use naive bayes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built four models and compared the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\assets\img\2019-05-May\2019-05-19-Classifying-Animals-Using-Machine-Learning\four_model_accuracy_barh.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Four Model Accuracy&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These models were built without any tuning of hyperparameters. Random forest
and decision tree were producing high accuracy and moved forward with these
algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used randomized grid search to tune the hyperparameters for a decision tree
and random forest model. Random forest produced the best results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\assets\img\2019-05-May\2019-05-19-Classifying-Animals-Using-Machine-Learning\confusion_matrix_random_forest.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Confusion Matrix Random Forest&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The random forest model correctly classified every observation in the test set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
I made a model that maps from animal features to the class of that animal using
random forest. The model was trained on 81 observations and tested on 20 observations. It had 100% accuracy on the test set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made an &lt;a href=&quot;https://animal-classifier.herokuapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interactive app&lt;/a&gt; that shows how the model works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for this project can be found on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ericchan24/Animal-Classification&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
